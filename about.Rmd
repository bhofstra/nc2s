## Netherlands Center for Computational Sociology (NC2S)
NC2S is a group of sociologists based at Dutch universities that study inequality, culture, and social relationships through a computational sociology approach. 
  
## Computational Sociology?
What is computational sociology? We define it as problem-driven, empirical sociology, but with the empirical part specifically containing some form of non-survey quantitative data source and/or some new methodological technique. Do you see yourself in this definition? Welcome! You are now a computational sociologist, and are more than welcome to join the NC2S!

## An Inclusive Definition
Computational sociologists are oftentimes interested in [digital footprints](https://jochemtolsma.github.io/SNA-4-Social-Scientists/webintro.html) concerning some social process related to inequality, culture, or social relationships. As digital footprints are very often related to social network processes (e.g., befriending on Facebook, messaging on Instagram, etc.), a lot of computational sociology oftentimes includes some form of social network analysis. Others claim Agent-Based Modelling to be part of computational sociology too, others not. Again others claim performing RSiena analyses is part of computational sociology, others not. 

Note that we think that this definition-issue is somewhat of a useless moving target. Computational sociologyâ€™s definition will be different next week depending on who you ask. We use a pragmatic and inclusive definition so as to draw in sociologists identifying with our defintion. This means that you are a computational sociologists if you use new data sources and/or use relatively new methodological techniques in your research.
